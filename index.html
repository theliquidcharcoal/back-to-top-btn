                There goes my heart beating<br>
                'Cause you are the reason<br>
                I'm losing my sleep<br>
                Please come back now<br>
                There goes my mind racing<br>
                And you are the reason<br>
                That I'm still breathing<br>
                I'm hopeless now<br>
                I'd climb every mountain<br>
                And swim every ocean<br>
                Just to be with you<br>
                And fix what I've broken<br>
                Oh, 'cause I need you to see<br>
                That you are the reason<br>
                There goes my hand shaking<br>
                And you are the reason<br>
                My heart keeps bleeding<br>
                I need you now<br>
                If I could turn back the clock<br>
                I'd make sure the light defeated the dark<br>
                I'd spend every hour, of every day<br>
                Keeping you safe<br>
                And I'd climb every mountain<br>
                And swim every ocean<br>
                Just to be with you<br>
                And fix what I've broken<br>
                Oh, 'cause I need you to see<br>
                That you are the reason, oh<br>
                (I don't wanna fight no more)<br>
                (I don't wanna hurt no more)<br>
                (I don't wanna cry no more)<br>
                (Come back, I need you to hold me closer now)<br>
                You are the reason, oh<br>
                (Just a little closer now)<br>
                (Come a little closer now)<br>
                (I need you to hold me tonight)<br>
                I'd climb every mountain<br>
                And swim every ocean<br>
                Just to be with you<br>
                And fix what I've broken<br>
                'Cause I need you to see<br>
                That you are the reason<br>
